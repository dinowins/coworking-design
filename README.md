### User Stories

* Target users: potential members of the co-working space (freelancers, entrepreneurs and their employees, remote workers, creatives), co-working management
* User persona: Teddy - "I need a workspace to code." - Teddy is a remote programmer for a small company looking for a nice and clean workspace where he can be productive.
* User persona: Lisa - "I need to find a place where I can be creative." - Lisa is an artist that wants somewhere to be creative while showcasing her talents and getting inspiration from her neighbors.
* User persona: Tanya - "I need a workspace for my startup." - Tanya wants to find a workspace that can host her startup and provide the usual amenities for a startup.
* As a member of the co-working startup, I want a hip, luxurious, and inclusive website that draws attention to our sense of community.  
* As an aspiring member of this co-working space, I want to see an organized list of the amenities provided and the subscription/membership model provided.
* As a tech worker, I want to see a gallery of the space so that I can determine if this is a place where I can be productive, but social.
* As a non-tech worker, I want to see the sense of community to determine if this is the right environment for me to work in.
* As an entrepreneur, I want to see a contact page where I can talk to the co-working space management about company fees as well pictures of the private offices available.
* As a woman seeking to work in a coworking space, I want to see a sense of an inclusive environment.

### Brainstorm and Research

* TechSpace uses a clean white format with a minimal looking font to create an IT culture/aesthetic
* WeWork uses a white format with a few tastefully placed colorful pictures to create a clean and creative feel
* Both websites cover the mission/culture, membership options and fees, and amenities provided.
* WorkingIt's website will have a clean white based format with vibrant colors placed artfully to convey the feeling that both tech and non-tech workers can feel productive.  
* Use a creative font to differentiate from other coworking spaces.
