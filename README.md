### Description

Do the web design process (user stories, sketching, wireframing, prototyping, and web development) for a coworking space company, WorkingIt. The website will convey to potential customers the feeling of being hip, luxurious, and inclusive.

### Images

Screenshots of your Sketch wireframes should go here. Make sure to include all versions (if you have different mobile, tablet, desktop, etc.) designs. Use Dropbox or another free image hosting service to host your images.

### User Stories

* Target users: potential members of the co-working space (freelancers, entrepreneurs and their employees, remote workers, creatives), co-working management
* As a member of the co-working startup, I want a hip, luxurious, and inclusive website that draws attention to our sense of community.  
* As an aspiring member of this co-working space, I want to see an organized list of the amenities provided and the subscription/membership model provided.
* As a tech worker, I want to see a gallery of the space so that I can determine if this is a place where I can be productive, but social.
* As a non-tech worker, I want to see the sense of community to determine if this is the right environment for me to work in.
* As an entrepreneur, I want to see a contact page where I can talk to the co-working space management about company fees as well pictures of the private offices available.
* As a woman seeking to work in a coworking space, I want to see a sense of an inclusive environment.

### Brainstorm and Research

* TechSpace uses a clean white format with a minimal looking font to create an IT culture/aesthetic
* WeWork uses a white format with a few tastefully placed colorful pictures to create a clean and creative feel
* Both websites cover the mission/culture, membership options and fees, and amenities provided.
* WorkingIt's website will have a clean white based format with vibrant colors placed artfully to convey the feeling that both tech and non-tech workers can feel productive.  
* Use a creative font to differentiate from other coworking spaces.
